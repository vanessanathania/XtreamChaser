After countless training sessions in live environments, Valerie has finally mastered this technique. Folks who have seen her soaring through the air refer to her as the Blade of Freedom</p>

				<h2>Krent</h2>
				<p>As a mercenary and leader of the international crime cartel known as the Black Dragon, he rises beyond mere brutality and aggression by also being sly and cunning. Originally from Australia, Krent is highly opportunistic and incredibly selfish, willing to betray his own realm and even his own allies for money or personal gain. As a result, he quickly became part of Jung Yin inner circle, and eventually the general of Outworld's armies (in the original timeline). One of his more notable features is his facetious and twisted sense of humor, almost always making light of dire circumstances</p>
