				<h5>Lore Information (cont..)</h5>
				<p>Denzel decided to toss Krent off a cliff, saying how if he were truly his son he'd be able to survive and climb back up. Krent did manage survive, but only after making a pact with Devil Jung Yin and instilling the Devil Gene in his blood. To further spite his son, Denzel adopted orphan Peach and raised her as a rival to Krent. Krent traveled across the world competing in martial arts championships, becoming an undefeated champion with the only mark on his record being a draw against Valerie. Eventually, Denzel decided to draw out his son by and announcing the first King of Iron Fist Tournament.</p>
